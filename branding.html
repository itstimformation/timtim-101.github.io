          These are some of the preliminary digital concepts I had created and
          put together. I tried with both lower and uppercase letters and
          discovered that I prefered the overall look of the uppercase
          lettering. It gave a cleaner and more contained look. I made the decision
          to develop the designs from the first column further and refine them
          until I acheived a look I was happy with.

          I looked into colour pallettes for my personal branding,
          discovering how they came together and how they would represent my
          brand. I experimented with different colours and combinations including
          colouring individual parts of the monogram. I also tried the same colours
          both a light and dark version of each colour.
          <br>
          <br>
          I added some patterns to a couple of the monograms. This worked but it
          didn't work with my brands style. I tried also used the 'fox colour
          scheme'. This was a reference to a concept for my visual marque which
          was the face of a fox. The idea was to acheive consistency across my
          brand.

          I played around with many different variations and styles
          for my wordmark. I discovered ways that don’t work well and new
          ideas that I really liked. The wordmarks on the left hand side were
          at the time my favourite and suited the branding well. They make use of
          the distinct shape of the letter D seen in my monogram.
          <br>
          <br>
          During this process, I inadvertently created a visual marque seen at
          the bottom of my designs. This takes the form of a fox made by merging
          the letters M and V in my name.I chose to persue this design and
          work on refining it.

          This was the original idea for my visual marque. The idea behind it was
          a literal brand made using the @ symbol which represents the internet.
          This combined the two things I wuld like to put a focus on which is branding
          and using digital mediums. It also had connotations of making things my
          own and giving them a mark people would recognise.

          I had been refining my ideas for my visual marque that represents
          me. I started out with the fox but this animal didn't exactly portray
          positive ideas. Sly and crafty aren’t the best words to describe my
          pesonality or style.
          <br>
          <br>
          When thinking of other animals that have a similar makeup I decided
          on a wolf. I then developed this idea in a similar style to the fox
          and refined the overall shape to allow it to link in together as seen
          in the seamless pattern above. The ideas associated with a wolf are mainly
          that they can strive as a lone wolf, or by integrated with a pack.
          This could show my ability to work well alone or as part of a bigger
          team.

          My visual marque is a very simple shape made up of the M and V from
          my wordmark. I have shown some of the variations on my visual marque
          as I my intention would be to have it as a dynamic brand tht changes depending on
          the context. The change could indicate a differnt project or style
          of work I am doing hence the paintbrush, pen, and pencil. You can also see
          my orignal fox and updated wolf idea for another marque.

          My original idea for my visual marque was the use of a fox. However
          the image and connotations surrounding foxes would not present well
          for my brand. The words that come to mind are ‘sly’ and 'crafty’,
          these aren’t exactly words you want associated with your brand and
          work ethos. Due to this, I decided to try and come up with a different
