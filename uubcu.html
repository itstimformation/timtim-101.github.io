          This was the original logo for the Ulster University Belfast
          Chrisitan Union (UUBCU). For being a design student in an art college,
          I couldn’t bear this design. Over the course of half a year, the
          look was going to change vastly. This project shows the process
          that took place and the final outcome of a successful rebrand!

          This was the inital design for the logo including a visual
          marque and a wordmark. The visual marque changed between a crown
          (seen above) and a set of three interlocking circles, representing
          the trinity. This logo just didn’t feel quite right or look slick
          enough for the image we wanted to project.
          <br>
          <br>
          The circles actually represent the initals of the society, UUCU, which
          stands for Ulster University Chrsitian Union. By not including the
          location, it allows for the logo to be implemented in other campuses.

          This was the second attempt at the logo, once again having the
          wordmark incorporated into the design. This was an adaption of the
          first logo making use of the circles. The circles idea came from
          the original logo as well as the idea that it can be self-sustaining
          when placed within any other design work or shown on it’s own.
          <br>
          <br>
          When testing the design, I tried this logo out in different styles and
          backgrounds to show the versatility. The paint streak was added
          as a gesture towards being part of the Belfast School of Art and
          Design.

          This was the final logo design chosen. The logo was a refinement of
          the first design. It makes the lines thinner and takes out all of the
          unneccessary words and extra features such as the visual marque in
          the centre and the line underneath. I am very happy with the way this
          logo has turned out. It fits in with the look for the CU
          <br>
          <br>
          The circles in this arrangement are a visual representation of the
          acronym ‘UUCU’ which stands for Ulster University Christian Union.
          This was the reasoning for putting the circles in this form.
          <br>
          <br>
          This design pulls some inspiration from the works of Josef Muller-Brockman’s
          visual of circles seen in much of his work

        <td>
          With the logo finalised, I looked more into the workdmark and how it
          would link with the visual marque. I first chose the font that would
          be used, this was Helvetica Neue LT Std 37 Thin Condensed.
          <br>
          <br>
          The positioning and wording was next. I had tried simply putting
          ‘Belfast’ inder the logo, as the logo encapsulated the societies
          identity of UUCU, but when the brand would launch, people would not
          know that the logo was a representation of these words, hence why I
          opted to include the letters 'UUBCU’.
          <br>
          <br>
          The wordmark also fitted best underneath the visual marque as opposed
          to inside as this limited the size it could be. The idea is that over
          time, the wordmark can be dropped to just leave the circles logo and
          people will automatically associate that with the CU.

        <td>
          With the design for the logo finally complete it was now time to work
          on refining the colours that could be used in the logo. We went through
          many different variations looking at changing all the lines, select
          lines, and the background.
          <br>
          <br>
          After working through all five of the colours seen in the first
          picture, it was narrowed down to the yellow and blue. The decision
          was also made to just change the ‘C’ in the logo and this allows the
          logo to be dynamic if another campus from Ulster University would
          liked to make use of the logo too.
          <br>
          <br>
          Ultimately, I went with the blue as it was versatile and would work
          on both light and dark backgrounds, it also adds a bit of flair into
          the logo to help it to stand out.
          <br>
          <br>
          I also played around with the use of colour on a wordmark.

          My original idea for my visual marque was the use of a fox. However
          the image and connotations surrounding foxes would not present well
          for my brand. The words that come to mind are ‘sly’ and 'crafty’,
          these aren’t exactly words you want associated with your brand and
          work ethos. Due to this, I decided to try and come up with a different
