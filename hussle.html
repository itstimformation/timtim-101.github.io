            <span class="overview">Overview:</span> The project consisted of
            producing the user interface for
            a travel app that could be used to
            explore different cities. Hussle
            focused on transportation within
            cities

          The start point for this project was to develop a set of icons that could
          be used for the app. As the app was based around cities, I developed a set
            that consisted of three iconic parts of well-known cities. I created
            Big Ben from London, the CN Tower from Toronto, and the Empire State
            Building fron New York City. After this I developed icons that could
            be used for control within the app itself. These represent different
            forms of transport.
            <br>
            <br>
            The colours chosen reflected the original colour scheme and app design.
            This was later changed.

          This was the original design for my app UI. After creating it, I didn't
          feel that it portrayed my style or the intended look of the app. I didn't
          like the colour pallette I originally used and thought it would be more
          suited for a kids app. After making this decision, I chose to restrt the
          design for the interface.

          This is the development process for the updated logo I created. At the
          top you can see the original logo in white which already was a step
          in the right direction for the look of my app. From there the
          designs flow into each other as they continue down. Eventually I
          arrived at the final logo which I was very pleased with.
          <br>
          <br>
          Throughout this process I developed the chevron marque. I was
          anle to extend this visual marque into other aspects of the app including
          acting as the background as well as being used in the logo. I felt this
          shape signified moving forward and hustling which is what the app
          is designed to help people do.

          These are the updated icons created for Hussle. I created Big Ben, the
          CN Tower, and the Empire State Building. They each signify a major
          city from around the world and are used to allow users to choose the
          city they are currently travelling in.
          <br>
          <br>
          The icons are made up of basic compound shapes. I liked the idea of
          simplicity both in colour and shape. This way it doesn’t distract
          the users attention but still allows people to easily recognise the
          city.

          These are some of the screens mocked up from my app to show how my
          UI would look on an actual iOS device.

          <br>
          I am realy pleased wiht the final style and layout of the app from
          previous versions. It has taken some inspiration from the Uber taxi
          app which has a sleek and professional look to it as well as being
          slightly playful and fun in it’s own way.
          <br>
          <br>
          I really liked the glowing luminescent effect on the key buttons and
          icons. This gave them a distinct look and helps users interact with
          the correct items.
