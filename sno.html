          The first thing I did was to research apps in general before
          looking deeper at weather apps. I looked at the most popular apps within
          various app stores. From these I studied each app in detail and looked
          at how they performed certain tasks. As part of this I got some users to
          test the apps and recorded their responses.
            <br>
            <br>
            From this research I then put out a user survey to discover more
            about the people using weather apps, how they used them, and what
            they enjoy and find frustrating.

          I moved onto developing the brand of the app. I started with the
          ‘Steeze’ brand and decided that I was going to use a wordmark
          to represent my brand rather than a visual marque. I tried different
          variations to help make this stand out and be distinct. I then thought
          about changing the word to 'Steezee’. This fitted better but seemed
          too long and bulky as a brand.
          <br>
          <br>
           I looked at the Swedish word for snow, Snö. This worked well as it
           suits the brand as well as being a short and snappy name for a brand.
           I also liked the idea of being able to use the different shapes of
           the word as visual extensions especially the dots above the 'O’. I
           then used the snowboard shape within this word too.

          As part of designing a great user experience, it is important to
          consider the user in all aspects of the process. These personas allow
          us to follow a user-specific journey through our product when testing
          it and see how they would react or find different scenarios and tasks.
          I created <a href="http://tim-davidson.com/user-personas.pdf" class="blog-link">a number of user personas</a> to use in the design of my app.
          <br>
          <br>
          As a part of this section of looking into the user I also created <a href="http://tim-davidson.com/sno/user-journey.pdf" class="blog-link">a user-journey
          map</a> . It helps to show how a user could navigate through my app. As my
          app has a focus on snow sports, I created the map to reflect the look
          of a classic piste map. Each run shows a different journey a user
          can take whilst the lifts help bring the user back to previous points
          in the app.

          This style tile helps to give an overview of how my weather app will
          look and feel for the user. It includes examples of typography, image
          style, and colour that will be implemented into the final design.

          I started by making a list of all the features that I wanted to have
          included in the app. From this I then divided them among the four
          different sections I was going to have in the app. This allowed me
          to see what needed to be included in each view .
          <br>
          <br>
          Some screens were simpler to create than others but it allowed me to
          get a feel for the user interface that I am creating.

          Using my sketches, I was able to produce a cleaner digital
          version of the UI designs. To do this I used <a href="https://marvelapp.com" class="blog-link">Marvel App</a>
          to put the screens together. It has also given me the opportunity to
          fit out the full resolution of an accurate canvas size as the canvas
          size seen here replicates an actual phone screen.
          <br>
          <br>
          This in turn helped me to produce an accurate list of graphics that now
          had to be produced to fit out the final prototype.
